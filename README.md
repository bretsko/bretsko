### Hi there 👋

#### I'm iOS developer, working on the following projects 


###  ⚙️  [Xcode extensions framework](https://github.com/XcodeExtKit)

3 extensions are currently developed - to handle structs/classes, enums and just Strings 


### ⚡️ [App](https://github.com/RunTracker) to track runs, like [Strava](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strava-run-ride-swim/id426826309)

Used technologies: MapKit, HealthKit, CoreLocation



### 🎙   Unofficial [Soundcloud App](https://github.com/SoundcloudUnofficialApp)

Has REST API client, working music player, some UI components
Used technologies: AVFoundation, MusicKit, CoreAnimation, KVO, Alamofire



###  🌍   Unofficial [Uber app](https://github.com/bretsko/Uber)
Refactored an old project

### Libraries   

- 💅 NLU / NLP framework in Swift

Contains lots of language models (like Word, Phrase) and parsing functions to build an English sentence. 
No Machine Learning is used so far 
In future can be used to make chatbots, parse and understand English sentences, do spell checking

- [Background timer](https://github.com/bretsko/TimerKit), using DispatchSourceTimer

- 🌱 Most my projects reuse code from [Base](https://github.com/bretsko/Base)  



### Other skills and technologies   

- 💅 Machine learning, [Some stuff I learned and read about](https://github.com/bretsko/AI-links)   

- 🌐 Familiar with algorithms, for example [Graph algorithms](https://github.com/bretsko/GraphAlgorithms)

- 🌱 C is the languages I started with, check this simple [local network scanner](https://github.com/bretsko/network-capture)
