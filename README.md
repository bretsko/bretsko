### Hi there 👋

#### I'm iOS developer, working on the following projects 


#####  ⚙️  XcodeExtKit

- [Xcode extensions framework](https://github.com/XcodeExtKit)

- Used technologies: Swift 

- 3 extensions are currently developed - to handle structs/classes, enums and just Strings 


#####  💅  NLU / NLP framework in Swift 

- a secret project ... 

- No Machine Learning is used so far 

- Contains lots of language models (like Word, Phrase) and parsing functions to build an English sentence

- In future can be used to make chatbots, parse and understand English sentences, do spell checking



##### Other projects (that I plan to continue)


- ⚡️ [App](https://github.com/RunTracker) to track runs, like [Strava](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strava-run-ride-swim/id426826309)
